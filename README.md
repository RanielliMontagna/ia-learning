## üìñ Introduction

This is a repository for learning AI, in this repository I will be learning AI and implementing it in different ways.

### üìâ Statistics for Developers

Build a solid foundation in Descriptive Statistics for Developers, crucial for data analysis, insights, and pattern recognition. Directly impacts machine learning model selection, parameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

### üêº Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Cover EDA concepts, Pandas library usage, data collection and preparation, handling missing data, hypothesis formulation, univariate and bivariate analysis, outliers, and automations. Extract insights before creating models.

### ü§ñ Machine Learning Fundamentals

Foundational module covering fundamental ML concepts, algorithms, challenges (overfitting, underfitting), ethics, and trends. Emphasis on practical learning for application in case studies, consolidating skills.

#### My First Model with Scikit-Learn

Consolidate learning with a practical module: develop your first machine learning model using Scikit-Learn. Apply concepts, evaluate models, and develop practical skills for future ML projects.

### üßÆ Supervised Learning Algorithms

#### Simple Linear Regression

First in a series of supervised algorithms, focusing on Simple Linear Regression. Prepare for real-world ML scenarios, using a practical approach from EDA to API implementation.

#### Multiple Linear Regression

Supervised algorithm with Multiple Linear Regression. Explore variable interactions and influences, starting with EDA, model construction, and ending with UI implementation.

#### Polynomial Regression

Dedicated module on polynomials and polynomial regression. From EDA to practical implementation in an application with API and interface development. Emphasis on cross-validation for accuracy and overfitting control.
